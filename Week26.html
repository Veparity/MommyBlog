            <p class="abelFont">I could feel little one moving around frequently, even as we moved back into her future mimi's home. One thing about pregnancy, for better or worse, is you're never quite alone. I can always feel a rumble right when I start to have moments where I forget I'm pregnant. Also don't think I've ever craved sweets this much, but I feel like I could always go for an ice cream; which is probably better than my usual 'I can always go for a coffee' mentality. She certainly moves around a lot at night, I can even see a foot or two poke out when she seems extra restless, not that I'm complaining I love seeing her be active. It's amazing how big my boobs are getting, love that, gonna end up getting another boob job just to maintain the breastfeeding titty size I'm sure. I'm enjoying imagining all the little outfits I'm going to put you in, sorry but you'll be my little doll until you can dress yourself.</p>
            <p class="abelFont">In addition to her excitingly jumping around in my belly, I'm going to safely assume she is also displaying excitement for me in starting a new career journey. I began a coding bootcamp this week, admist a hurricane at that! So by the time you com into the world, I'll be in a new career field, in fact what I'm learning in it is helping me build this! And yes you read that right, we just barely dodged a Category 5 hurricane (Ian), so that old folklore of the Indians placing a protection around Pinellas continues to hold its weight!</p>

              <p class="abelFont">Well lord knows if I stretch too fast it feels like my abdominal muscles are pulling apart at the seems. I think I miss standing comfortably for more than an hour at a time. God, did I mention the constant trips to the bathroom? Yes I could stop drinking water at 6pm, but for what? To feel like a fish out of water by 10pm? No thanks, I guess I'm just stuck waking up every few hours. Not the worst thing in the world, it at least wakes me up from the un-nervingly realistic dreams I continue to have! </p>
